Starter code taken from [Xandromus](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme)<br>
Module work from the UoM bootcamp helped get the basics for some of this project. <br>
[Web.dev](https://web.dev/codelab-make-installable/) -for the install button in src/js/install.js . Was having the most difficulty with this as it wasn't the same way we did it in the Module work
